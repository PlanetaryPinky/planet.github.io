## My Projects
Here are a list of projects I’m working on:

- **[LinkLoaderVN](link_to_your_project)**: A simple visual novel prototype.
- **[CTS 285 Sandbox](link_to_your_project)**: Sample libraries with examples.

### Useful Links
- [Markdown Tutorials](link_to_tutorial)
- [GitHub Pages Quickstart](link_to_quickstart)
- [Information for CTI 110](link_to_information)

_Remember, you’ll want to build on your skills by taking more programming classes! CSC 134, CSC 121, CSC 151 are good next steps._

[Al Sweigart’s books](https://inventwithpython.com/) are free online and a good place to keep working on Python.
